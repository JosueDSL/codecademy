The style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors to be used.

Each color should have:

A name
A box displaying the color itself.
The CSS value used to create the color (in hex, rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), or hsla()).
An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.

Basically create a color palette for the general website.

Te style should include a labeled section of the fonts to be used
For each font, the goal is to to demonstrate the various styles that are intended to be used (font weight, style, size, and text decorations). 
The following for every font should be included:

The font name
A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could include: plain, bold and italic, underlined).
For each style, include a sentence or series of words to demonstrate the text style (our example site uses the quick brown foxâ€¦).
